## Roll Setup

This repository contains some code to seed a roll application user
used to lock down requests to [Roll](https://github.com/xtraclabs/roll),
and to create a user agaist roll after obtaining an access token
as the roll application user.

The functions performed are essentially those shown in the README.md file
associated with roll.
